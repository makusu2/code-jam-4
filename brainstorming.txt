To do:
```
*Tutorial sprite (Phyro)
*Tutorial popups (Maku)
*Fancier text window (Yui)
*Lootbox open/close sprites (Phyro)
*Allow the keyboard to send keys to other windows like a true onscreen keyboard (Unclaimed, preferably Maku)
*If a key gets too large and can't grow anymore, it should get pushed to the topleftmost key (and shrunken)
```
Addon ideas that we can do whenever:
```
*Accessibility option that's ironically detrimental to the user's disability
*Super sketchy tutorial maybe
*Be annoyingly user friendly
*Maybe explain everything (tutorials) with symbols, no text?
```
